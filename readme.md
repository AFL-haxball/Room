# üèà Haxfootball Bot

American Football gameplay implemented in haxball. Rules adapted to fit 5v5 and 4v4 games.

Contents:

1.  Full source code, separated into files and folders, found in **/src**
2.  Single file, compiled source code, found in **/dist/room-bundle.js**
3.  Single file, old Season 13 HFL bot, by I'llhaveanother found in **/dist/hfl-13.js**

# ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

You can use the code in two ways

1.  Copy the **room-bundle.js** file found in **/dist** and paste it in the console on https://www.haxball.com/headless
2.  Use the built in RoomLoader class to load the room using puppeteer.

### Using Haxball Headless

1. Go to https://www.haxball.com/headless
2. Right Click => Inspect Element
3. Go to to the tab labeled "console"
4. Select "top" from the dropdown
5. Paste the code, and press enter

**How do I change the name of the room, or make it private?**
Do CTRL + F and search for "HAXFOOTBALL" which is the name of the room, and then you can change it to whatever you would like.

### Using Puppeteer RoomLoader

Webpack will create two bundles, one for the room, and one for index.ts to actually load the rooms using puppeteer.

1. First run the **build** command so you can build both bundles.

   npm run build

2. Configure changes in **/server/index.ts** to your liking, i.e headless mode and auto join

3. Run the **start** command to load the room.

   npm run start
